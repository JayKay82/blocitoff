## BlocItOff

BlocItOff is the first project in the projects stage of my Bloc Web Dev apprenticeship.  
I'm building it with the help of my mentor Felix Clack.

BlocItOff is an _awesome_ ToDo list app.  
You may be thinking "Do we really need another on of those?"  
Hell yeah, we do!!! This one has self-destructing list items, **Mission Impossible** style.
